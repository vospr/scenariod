# Implementation: T-001 — Initialize Node.js project scaffold
**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Changes Made

- `package.json`: Created with name `health-check-api`, version `1.0.0`. Express `^4.18.2` as runtime dependency. Jest `^29.7.0` and supertest `^6.3.4` as devDependencies. `npm start` runs `node src/server.js`; `npm test` runs `jest --testEnvironment node`. `engines.node` set to `>=18`.
- `src/app.js`: Created minimal Express app scaffold — requires express, creates app instance, uses `express.json()` middleware, exports app without calling `app.listen()`. This is the app/server split pattern; the app is importable by tests without port binding.
- `src/routes/.gitkeep`: Created to ensure `src/routes/` directory is tracked by git.
- `tests/.gitkeep`: Created to ensure `tests/` directory is tracked by git.
- `package-lock.json`: Generated by `npm install` (355 packages, 0 vulnerabilities).
- `.gitignore`: Pre-existing file already contains `node_modules/` — no modification needed.

## Decisions Made During Implementation

- Used `^4.18.2` for Express (latest stable 4.x) — pinned to major version to allow patch/minor updates while avoiding breaking changes from Express 5.
- Used `^29.7.0` for Jest (latest stable 29.x) — mature, stable, zero-config for Node.js CommonJS.
- Used `^6.3.4` for supertest — npm showed deprecation warning recommending upgrade to v7.1.3+, but spec constrains version; warnings are non-blocking and do not affect functionality.
- `--testEnvironment node` flag added to `npm test` script to avoid jsdom overhead for a server-side API project.
- Created `src/app.js` as a minimal Express app skeleton at this stage rather than leaving it empty — this ensures the scaffold is coherent and buildable before T-002 adds routes.
- `.gitkeep` files used (instead of `.gitkeep` or README placeholders) to preserve empty directories in git without adding noise.

## Assertion Evidence

| Assertion ID | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | PASS | `package.json:1` — file exists at project root |
| A2 | PASS | `package.json:11-13` — `"express": "^4.18.2"` in `dependencies` |
| A3 | PASS | `package.json:14-17` — `"jest": "^29.7.0"` and `"supertest": "^6.3.4"` in `devDependencies` |
| A4 | PASS | `node_modules/express/package.json` exists; `npm install` produced 355 packages, 0 vulnerabilities (exit 0) |
| A5 | PASS | `src/` directory created; `src/routes/` directory created (with `.gitkeep`); `tests/` directory created (with `.gitkeep`) |
| A6 | PASS | `.gitignore:9` — `node_modules/` line already present |
| A7 | PASS | `npm install` ran successfully — 355 packages added, 0 vulnerabilities, `package-lock.json` generated |

## Testing

- Verified `node_modules/express/package.json` exists (express installed).
- Verified `node_modules/jest/package.json` exists (jest installed).
- Verified `node_modules/supertest/package.json` exists (supertest installed).
- Verified `package-lock.json` generated by `npm install`.
- Verified `src/`, `src/routes/`, `tests/` directories present via Glob tool.
- Verified `.gitignore` contains `node_modules/` at line 9.
- `npm test` not run at this stage — no test files exist yet (T-003 writes them).
