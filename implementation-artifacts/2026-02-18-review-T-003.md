# Review: T-3 — Write Jest + supertest tests for GET /health
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Reviewer:** reviewer agent (cycle 1)

STATUS: APPROVED

ISSUES:

1. [MINOR] tests/health.test.js:44 — A6 monotonicity check uses >= (same-millisecond passes). Weak freshness signal.
   FIX_GUIDANCE: Use toBeGreaterThan with small delay, or document that equal timestamps are acceptable.

2. [MINOR] tests/health.test.js:1-46 — No afterAll teardown. Supertest auto-closes, but Jest --detectOpenHandles may warn.
   FIX_GUIDANCE: Add no-op afterAll comment or use --forceExit in test script.

3. [MINOR] implementation-artifacts/2026-02-18-impl-T-003.md:25 — A3 evidence cites line 20, actual assertion at line 19.
   FIX_GUIDANCE: Update impl artifact line reference to :19.

## Spec Review
All 6 assertions (A1-A6) verified against actual test code. File scope clean. No fabricated evidence.

SUMMARY: Implementation correct and complete. All spec assertions map to verifiable test code. Three MINOR issues noted, none blocking. Ready to unblock T-4.
