# Review: T-002 — Implement GET /health endpoint
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Reviewer:** reviewer agent (cycle 1)

STATUS: APPROVED

ISSUES:

1. [MINOR] implementation-artifacts/2026-02-18-impl-T-002.md:21-27 — Evidence format uses table instead of Section 11 bulleted format; cites smoke test output instead of file:line code references for A1-A4.
   FIX_GUIDANCE: Use canonical format: `A1: PASS — src/routes/health.js:8 (res.status(200))`

2. [MINOR] src/server.js:7 — No error event handler on app.listen(). EADDRINUSE would produce raw stack trace.
   FIX_GUIDANCE: Add `server.on('error', ...)` handler. Can be deferred to hardening task.

## Spec Review
All 7 assertions (A1-A7) independently verified against actual code. No fabricated evidence, no scope violations, no missing results.

SUMMARY: Implementation correct, secure, and ADR-compliant. All spec assertions satisfied. Two MINOR issues noted, neither blocking. Ready to unblock T-3.
